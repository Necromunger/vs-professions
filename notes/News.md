Hello everyone!
I wanted to give an overview to some of the planned mods making their way to the server.
Let us know of any feedback / preferences or anything we missed in feedback.

**Professions** 
We will be making custom classes for Rot World that are based around useful professions while also evening the playing field for PvP and PvE of all classes. 
Movement speed, damage and health have all been made equal for all classes, with a slight movement speed buff for all of 10% from the hunter class.
This should help group play in that you no longer need to worry about fighting related bonuses and also give more advantages as the following 5 classes are the combination of several others.

## Steward

Traits:
  - Farming
  - Cooking

## Ranger
Master of the forest

Traits:
  - Woodsman
  - Forager
  - Furtive

## Metalsmith
  
## Artisan
  
## Physician
